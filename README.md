# Decklist Genie
A simple web app to help create a PDF of deck list used for submission at Pokemon events.

## Project Description
Developed a tool to streamline deck list submission for Pokémon-sanctioned events. Participants who practice using Pokémon Trading Card Game Live (PTCG Live) can copy their digital deck and paste it into the tool which automatically generates a printable deck list for official submission, enhancing convenience and accuracy.
